This folder includes my notes and Exercise Files for Josh McQuinston's LinkedIn Learning course, "Introducing Jupyter".  The PDF document titled "CourseNotes_Introducing Jupyter" provides a description of the course and contains notes I wrote myself through each chapter. Each Notebook file contains code I wrote as I followed along, as well. A few skills I developed in doing so include efficiency in using cell and line magic commands, and data visualization using tables, line graphs, and bar graphs. I learned how to optimize the way I present data by adding descriptions, subplots, and varying colors.
