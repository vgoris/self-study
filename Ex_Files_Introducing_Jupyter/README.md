This folder includes my notes and Exercise Files for Josh McQuinston's LinkedIn Learning course, "Introducing Jupyter". Each Notebook file contains code I wrote as I followed along through each chapter. A few skills I developed in doing so include efficiency in using cell and line magic commands, and data visualization using tables, line graphs, and bar graphs. I learned how to optimize the way I present data by adding descriptions, subplots, and varying colors.
