# self-study
This repository contains code and study materials I used to become proficient in tools and programming languages such as PostgreSQL. Files titled "CourseNotes_" are PDF documents provided by LinkedIn Learning that provide a description of the course and notes I took during each chapter. I included a more detailed description of my study methods and the resources I used in each project folder's README.md file.
