# self-study
This repository contains code and study materials I used to become proficient in tools and programming languages such as PostgreSQL. Files titled "CourseNotes_" are PDF documents provided by LinkedIn Learning that provide a description of the course and notes I took during each chapter. I included a more detailed description of my study methods and the resources I used below. 

### LinkedIn Learning: _Introducing Jupyter_ by Josh McQuinston
This folder includes my notes and Exercise Files for Josh McQuinston's LinkedIn Learning course, "Introducing Jupyter". Each Notebook file contains code I wrote as I followed along through each chapter. A few skills I developed in doing so include efficiency in using cell and line magic commands and data visualization using tables, line graphs, and bar graphs. I learned how to optimize the way I present data by adding descriptions, subplots, and varying colors.

### LinkedIn Learning: _PostgreSQL Essential Training_ by Adam Wilbert
This folder contains my learning materials for "PostgreSQL Essential Training", a LinkedIn Learning course taught by Adam Wilbert. I learned how to execute commands in the Postgres database in two ways: once using the pgAdmin interface as demonstrated by the instructor, and for the second time as I typed the corresponding SQL commands in code written in these files. Notes I took about each of these commands are included as comments, in addition to the CourseNotes PDF file that has additional information I learned about the Postgres server, naming conventions, and managing the Postgres interface. 

### LinkedIn Learning: _GitHub Quick Tips_ by Ray Villalobos
Included in this repository are my notes for Ray Villalobos' LinkedIn Learning Course, "GitHub Quick Tips". I learned how to be more efficient in using GitHub and how to take advantage of various tools provided, including gists, wikis, and templates. 

### LinkedIn Learning: _Learning GitHub_ by Aaron Stewart and GitHub
I took "Learning GitHub", a LinkedIn Learning Course with Aaron Stewart and GitHub as instructors, to learn about GitHub and version control systems (VCS) such as Git. Included in this repository are the notes I took as I followed along through each chapter and gained an understanding of GitHub workflows in creating/committing branches, and using the command line and the GitHub desktop and online interfaces to do so.
