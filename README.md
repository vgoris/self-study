# self-study
This repository contains code and study materials I used to become proficient in tools and programming languages such as PostgreSQL. Files titled "CourseNotes_" are PDF documents provided by LinkedIn Learning that provide a description of the course and notes I took during each chapter. I included a more detailed description of my study methods and the resources I used in each project folder's README.md file. 

### LinkedIn Learning: Introducing Jupyter by Josh McQuinston
This folder includes my notes and Exercise Files for Josh McQuinston's LinkedIn Learning course, "Introducing Jupyter". Each Notebook file contains code I wrote as I followed along through each chapter. A few skills I developed in doing so include efficiency in using cell and line magic commands and data visualization using tables, line graphs, and bar graphs. I learned how to optimize the way I present data by adding descriptions, subplots, and varying colors.

### LinkedIn Learning: PostgreSQL Essential Training by Adam Wilbert
This folder contains my learning materials for "PostgreSQL Essential Training", a LinkedIn Learning course taught by Adam Wilbert. I learned how to execute commands in the Postgres database in two ways: once using the pgAdmin interface as demonstrated by the instructor, and for the second time as I typed the corresponding SQL commands in code written in these files. Notes I took about each of these commands are included as comments, in addition to the CourseNotes PDF file that has additional information I learned about the Postgres server, naming conventions, and managing the Postgres interface.
